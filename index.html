        <div class="main">While we take the web for granted in the modern age, the internet as a whole has seen massive leaps in evolution from its beginnings as a CERN project. 
            The World Wide Web is a service for the near instant transmission of data from nearly anywhere in the world that can be used to connect people and business around the world. 
            Being older, I remember getting dial-up internet and setting up my first @aol.com email. The internet and how we access it has come a long way. <br><br>

His idea started with the need to get from one piece of information to another (CrashCourse 2017). Until this point, 
            information was only available in a physical, linear form. Information was stored in words on a page that you read in the proper order to understand their meaning. This becomes cumbersome as the amount of data grows. Reading through one book can take 
            time, having to read an entire encyclopedia to find what you need is not feasible. Vannevar took this concept and visualized it with his idea for a machine he called the Memex. He thought of a machine that could think more akin to how people think. 
            Our brains work in webs, quickly being able to jump from idea to idea, unlike the systems at the time that could only read in single lines (CrashCourse 2017). In his piece “As We May Think” published in the Atlantic in June of 1945, Bush said 
            "Thus science may implement the ways in which man produces, stores, and consults the record of the race." His ideas led to the revolution we know today as the World Wide Web (Bush 1945). <br><br>

           src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/ae/CERN_logo.svg/1200px-CERN_logo.svg.png" alt="CERN Institute Logo"> The next massive breakthrough was in the 1980’s at CERN. Tim Berners-Lee, who is accredited as the father of the web, started to research Hypertext. Berners-Lee said "Back in the 1980's CERN was an exciting place to be.” 
            “...lots and lots of information systems on different computers, all incompatible.” (CERN 2019). There needed to be a way to make all of these systems talk, and he began his work on the WorldWideWeb tool. Tim wrote the first proposal from the 
            WorldWideWeb in 03/89 then refined it with an additional proposal in 05/90. By the end of 1990, Berners-Lee had built the first Web Server and Browser running NeXT. This creation, WorldWideWeb was released to the public as the first web browser 
            (CERN 2019).  <br><br>
            
            After the release of WorldWideWeb, a team at the University of Illinois used it as a framework for their browser. In 1993 that team would release their tool Mosaic to the world and kick off the browser competition. Through the 90’s more browsers 
            began to pop up on the market. Browsers like Netscape, OmniWeb, Opera, Internet Explorer and Mozilla quickly gained popularity (CrashCourse 2017). As a child, I went to a brand-new elementary school in South Florida that had the latest technology at 
            the time, iMacs equipped with Netscape. Using these tools, we learned how to access the web and search the new tool with our teachers, who themselves had never used. By 1995, my family had its first internet connected computer running Windows 95 
            equipped with Internet Explorer or IE. Web browsers only became more ubiquitous as they became preinstalled on all new systems as everyone was expected to have a web presence. <br><br>
            
            <img class="mainpagepic fleft"  src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.bunkhistory.org/derivatives/rectangle_large/images/2019-09/$2y$10$ASR4i5hrtr.uQOQfB6Bjuni.6BUUZTJ0JLNzE3qEmHj4bEKmef./Bill_Gates_testimony.png" alt="Bill Gates providing sworn testimony">The meteoric rise of web browsers brought competition, not all of it productive. As personal computing became a necessity for most people, certain names rose to popularity. The most well-known being Bill Gates’ Microsoft. 
            Microsoft saw the popularity of the web, and wanted to make sure they owned a sizable piece of the pie. Microsoft began shipping new copies of Windows with their newest web browser, Internet Explorer. This gave the average user a web browser free of 
            charge, but also kicked off what was nicknamed the First Browser War (Chandrasekaran 1998). This intense competition for browsers led to a penultimate moment where Microsoft found themselves in a landmark anti-trust lawsuit. Microsoft tried to buy 
            Netscape in the early 1990’s, but was unsuccessful and was alleged to have made it their mission to "cut off Netscape's air supply" as described by Steven McGeady, Vice President of Intel. While the lawsuit was eventually over turned, this laid the 
            foundation for Internet Explorer to become the dominant browser, peaking in 2001 with 96% of the market share (Chandrasekaran 1998). <br><br> 

            Where are we now? Browsers have come and gone. Internet Explorer is essentially dead to the normal user, Mozilla is now called Firefox, and Google’s Chrome platform is by far the king. Google launched Chrome in September of 2008 and quickly became a 
            juggernaut of the industry (Pachai 2008). By May of 2012, PCWorld magazine reported that Chrome was now the most popular browser in the world. At the time they managed a market share of over 32%. By 2017 Chrome was installed on more devices than not, 
            holding a market share in excess of 60% (Ionescu 2012). Andreas Gal, former CTO of Mozilla, wrote a blog post titled “Chrome Won” where he runs through the numbers and how the company he once helped lead the charge of had fallen nearly to the bottom of 
            the pack (Gal 2017). The only browser used with less frequency? Internet Explorer, the last of the old guard.  <br><br>

            Computer browsers have seen multiple major cycles in their over 30 year history since inception. They’ve progressed immensely, from a simple tool that displays text and images, to a tool that can house entire programs and systems locally. 
            Our interconnection with the world around us only deepens as we expand our web to be truly worldwide.    </div>
